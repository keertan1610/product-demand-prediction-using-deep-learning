Product Demand Prediction Using Deep Learning

1. Overview

This project aims to forecast product demand using deep learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data and external influencing factors, the model helps businesses optimize inventory management, reduce costs, and meet customer demands efficiently. 

 2.Requirements

Python: Version 3.8 or higher
Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Dataset: Historical product sales data (e.g., sales_data.csv).

3.Technologies Used

Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras
Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model Evaluation: Scikit-learn

4.Setup Instructions

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd product-demand-prediction

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install required libraries using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Prepare the Dataset
Place your dataset file (sales_data.csv) in the data/ directory.
Ensure the dataset has columns like:
Date
Product_ID
Sales
Additional features (e.g., Promotion, Holiday).
Step 4: Preprocess Data
Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform data:

python preprocess.py

Step 5: Train the Model
Train the deep learning model with the preprocessed data:

python train.py

This generates a trained model saved in the models/ directory.

Step 6: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance:

python evaluate.py

Results (e.g., RMSE, MAE) will be displayed in the console.

Step 7: Make Predictions
Use the trained model to predict future demand:

python predict.py --input data/test_data.csv --output results/predictions.csv
